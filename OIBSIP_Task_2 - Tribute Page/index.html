            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained the Indian team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.</p>

        <div>
            As Mahendra Singh Dhoni bids adieu to international cricket, here is a look at the career highlights of India's most successful captain, who led the country to two World Cup trophies. <br><br>
            <b>December 2004:</b> Dhoni makes his international debut against Bangladesh in an ODI at Chittagong. <br><br>
            
            <b>October 2005:</b> Promoted up the order to accelerate scoring, Dhoni smashes an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, the then record of the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings. <br><br>
            
            <b>Dhoni</b> also wins Man of the Series award after India's 3-0 triumph in the five-match rubber. <br><br>
